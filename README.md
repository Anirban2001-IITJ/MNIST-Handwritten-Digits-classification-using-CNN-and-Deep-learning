𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 : The 𝐌𝐍𝐈𝐒𝐓 database (𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐞𝐝 𝐍𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐮𝐭𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐲) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.
‣ 𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 : Develop a Machine Learning model for predicting handwritten digits (formely on 'gray scale' ) using the MNIST dataset using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Deep Learning (TensorFlow, Keras)
◽ 𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰 :
‣ 𝐌𝐍𝐈𝐒𝐓 Dataset - (10 Class classification of 28 x 28 = 784 pixel values, each Pixel values is between 0-255)
 𝟎 : Fully Black
𝟐𝟓𝟓 : Fully White
‣ Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
‣ CNN (Conv2D, Max-Pooling2D, Dense, Flatten, DropOut)
‣ Deep Learning (TensorFlow, Keras, Sequential Plotting)
‣ Normalizing and Hyperparameter Tuning (By taking Integral value between 0 to 255)
‣ Determining the shape of input images
‣ Defining the 2D Convolutional layer (Using Activation function "ReLU" and "Softmax" combining Dense factor (500,10)
‣ Summarized and Plotted the Model :
i) 𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐳𝐞𝐫='adam' → Uses the "Adam" optimizer, which adapts the learning rate for each parameter, 
ii) 𝐞𝐩𝐨𝐜𝐡𝐬=10 → The model will go through the dataset 10 times
‣ Achieved 𝟗𝟗.𝟐𝟐 % accuracy after calculating the value of the loss function
‣ 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 : Predicting the "gray scale" image based on each pixel it covers and finally returns the actual output.
